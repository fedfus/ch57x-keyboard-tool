# Normal keyboard orienation is when buttons are on the left
# side and knobs are on the right. However, you may want to use
# the keyboard in another orienation. To avoid remapping button
# positions in your head, just set it here.
# Possible values are:
#   (horizontal)
#   - 'normal': buttons on the left, knobs on the right
#   - 'upsidedown': buttons on the right, knobs on the left
#   (vertical)
#   - 'clockwise': buttons on the top, knobs on the bottom
#   - 'counterclockwise': buttons on the bottom, knobs on the top
orientation: normal

# There are different models of keyboard with different numbers
# of buttons and knobs. Set it here for proper handling.
# Count rows and columns with the keyboard in normal orienation,
# with knobs on the right side.
rows: 2
columns: 3
knobs: 1

# Layers are sets of alternative key mappings.
# The current layer is changed using a button on the side of the keyboard
# and displayed with LEDs on top (only for the moment of changing).
# All keyboards I saw had three layers, but I suppose other variants
# exist.
